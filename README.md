# acro
An irc game where you create acros with your friends

**If you just want to play the game, join us in #acrogame @ EFNet irc network**

A simple/fun irc game, where people make phrases (acronyms) with the letters the bot gives you. for example, the bot could start a round w/ the letters 'YEIS', and you could /msg bot *Your epidermus is showing*.

After all acronyms have been submitted, every person who submitted can vote for other peoples acronyms (you can't vote for your own), and whoever gets the most votes, wins the round. Each round win gains you 3 points, and games usually go up to 15 points, though this could be changed.

This code is a module for [sopel](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel), an irc bot framework created w/ python.

Have fun and happy acro'ing!
